# HC256StreamCipher

This is a simplistic, naive and probably wrong implementation of
HC 256 (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HC-256) directly from
the source code in the paper that is or was at one time available
here: http://eprint.iacr.org/2004/092.pdf

It works on gcc on a Mac OS X computer at the time of this writing.

I claim no ownership of any part of this and post it as an academic
curiosity only.
